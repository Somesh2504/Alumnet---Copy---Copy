# Token Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The token was disappearing from localStorage on page refresh, even though it was being stored during login. The authentication system was primarily relying on httpOnly cookies, but the frontend needed the token to persist in localStorage for proper authentication state management.

## Root Causes
1. **Mixed Authentication Strategy**: Using both cookies and localStorage but not properly coordinating them
2. **Missing Token Retrieval**: AppContext didn't check localStorage for existing tokens on page load
3. **Incomplete Backend Support**: Backend middlewares only checked cookies, not Authorization headers
4. **Inconsistent Token Storage**: Some login functions didn't store tokens in localStorage

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced AppContext Authentication Flow**
- **File**: `Frontend/src/context/AppContext.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added localStorage token checking in `checkAuthStatus()`
  - Enhanced `fetchUser()` and `fetchCollegeUser()` to include Authorization headers
  - Added `fetchAdminUser()` function for admin authentication
  - Updated authentication flow to try multiple user types

### 2. **Updated Backend Middlewares**
- **Files**: 
  - `Backend/middlewares/authUser.js`
  - `Backend/middlewares/authCollege.js`
  - `Backend/middlewares/authAdmin.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for Bearer token authentication via Authorization header
  - Maintained backward compatibility with cookie-based authentication
  - Priority: Authorization header first, then cookies

### 3. **Enhanced Login Functions**
- **Files**:
  - `Frontend/src/pages/CollegeLogin.jsx`
  - `Frontend/src/pages/AdminLogin.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added token storage in localStorage for CollegeLogin
  - Updated AdminLogin to store token from backend response
  - Ensured consistent token storage across all user types

### 4. **Updated Backend Admin Controller**
- **File**: `Backend/Controller/AdminController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added token to admin login response for localStorage storage

## Authentication Flow Now Works As Follows:

### **On Login:**
1. User submits login credentials
2. Backend validates and returns token in response
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### **On Page Refresh:**
1. AppContext checks localStorage for existing tokens
2. If token found, includes it in Authorization header
3. Backend middleware checks Authorization header first, then cookies
4. If authentication succeeds, user state is restored
5. If authentication fails, localStorage is cleared

### **On Logout:**
1. Frontend calls appropriate logout endpoint
2. Backend clears cookies
3. Frontend clears localStorage and state

## Key Benefits:
✅ **Token Persistence**: Tokens now persist across page refreshes
✅ **Dual Authentication**: Supports both cookie and token-based authentication
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cookie-based auth still works
✅ **Security**: httpOnly cookies still used for primary authentication
✅ **Consistency**: All user types (student, alumni, college, admin) work the same way

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test login/logout flow for all user types
2. Test page refresh after login
3. Test browser developer tools to verify token storage
4. Test authentication with cookies disabled (should still work with tokens)
5. Test authentication with localStorage disabled (should fall back to cookies)

## Files Modified:
- **Frontend**: 3 files (AppContext, CollegeLogin, AdminLogin)
- **Backend**: 4 files (3 middlewares + AdminController)

The token should now persist properly in localStorage across page refreshes while maintaining the security benefits of httpOnly cookies.
